I found gaara:ismyname from one of the directories found in Cryoserver
maybe its ssh lets see
wasn't the passwd so hydra maybe
passwd was iloveyou2 after hydra
found three files flag.txt Kazekage.txt(written in brainfuck)

decrypted Kazekage and it read "Did you really think you could find something that easily? Try Harder!
"

decrypted flag.txt and found "gaaraisthebest"
