base64 decrypting gives KRYPTONISGREAT
rot13 decryption gives  LEVEL TWO PASSWORD ROTTEN
l2-3 there's an encrypt file  which requires a keyfile to encrypt 
i put  in abc it gave back mno
i put in the contents of  the password and it gave back AYCQYPGQCYQWOMQEMDUEQMEK 
 i'm supposed to use tr '[M-ZA-Lm-za-l]' '[A-MN-Za-mn-z]'
 i need to relearn tr command 
 password was CAESARISEASY

l3-4 frequency analysis
 most prevalent letters in the found files 
 	found1  found2	foundd3
 	 	c= 6.9 	4.0	6.1
 	j=6.6	7.4	7.3	
    n = 4.8 6.3	5.5	
 	g =5.3 5.2	6.2	
 	b = 5.6	6.1	5.3
 	d=4.5  5.6	3.9
 	q=10.1  8.7	8.6
 	u= 6.5  6.1 4.8
 	s=		11.4 103
frequency analysis came in handy jcrypttool was pivotal
to check whicj=h letter replaced which 
passwd was brute

quipquip
## i need to put more time into crytptography

l4-5 e
vigenere cipher
key length 6ear text
vigener cipher
found the passwd as clear text
password is cleartext
 l5-6 
  polyaplhabetic cipher

l6 stopped there for now
